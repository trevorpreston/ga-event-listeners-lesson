```
var puppies = [
	'husky',
	'lab',
	'bulldog',
	'frenchie',
	'irish wolf hound'
]
```

create in your lab directory, create a new directory called "timer-lab". In "timer-lab" initiate a new index.html and main.js, then link them together.

add a console.log('js connected!') to the top to verify it works!

1. create a function that console.logs "it's puppy time" after a 3 second delay.
2. create a function that console.logs each puppy from the the array "puppies".
3. create a "style.css" file and link it to your html.  In your html add a div with the id "display".  Then in your css, give the display a background color of "peachpuff" and do the necessary CSS to make sure the "display" covers the entire screen.
4. In your javascript, create an interval and a function that appends each of the puppies into the display.  They can be appended as basic p tags, or divs, or whatever.  Style is cool.
